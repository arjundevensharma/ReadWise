# ReadWise

2nd place at the HackOrange hackathon, which was my first hackathon ever.

## Inspiration

When I was a student at my old elementary school, I noticed that many of the books available in the library were not at the appropriate reading level for students. Additionally, many students didn't have an interest in reading in the first place. Often, I was able to encourage students to start reading simply by suggesting them books that were appropriate to their level of reading. This inspired me to create a project that could address this issue.

## What it does

The project is called ReadWise. It provides a reading test that presents a passage for students to read through, followed by a comprehension quiz. After submitting the quiz, the user is provided with their reading speed and a book recommendation based on their performance.

## How we built it

I created the project using the Vue.js framework, which was a new and challenging experience for me since I had only ever coded using Java, with the only user interface I had ever incorporated being console prompts. I faced challenges in figuring out how to track the time, using buttons for the reading passages, and configuring a quiz screen and using that data to inform further decisions.

## Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge was learning how to use Vue.js effectively. This framework is complex, and it took a lot of trial and error to figure out how to use it properly. Additionally, I didn't have a lot of time to work on the project due to other commitments.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite the challenges, I was able to create a working project that provides value to students who struggle with reading. I'm proud of the fact that I was able to learn and use a new framework effectively to build this project.

## What we learned

Through this project, I learned how to use the Vue.js framework and build a functional website. I also learned about the importance of making reading accessible to students by providing appropriate resources.

## What's next for ReadWise

In the future, I would like to expand the project to include a wider range of reading levels and genres. I also plan to add additional features to the website, such as a search function and personalized reading recommendations. Overall, I hope to continue making reading more accessible and enjoyable for students and individuals of all ages.
